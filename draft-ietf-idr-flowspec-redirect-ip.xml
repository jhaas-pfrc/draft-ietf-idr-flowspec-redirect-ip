    <abstract>
      <t>Flow-spec is an extension to BGP that allows for the dissemination of
      traffic flow specification rules. This has many possible applications, but
      the primary one for many network operators is the distribution of traffic
      filtering actions for distributed denial of service (DDoS) mitigation.
      The flow-spec standard <xref target="RFC5575"/> defines a redirect-to-VRF
      action for policy-based forwarding.  This mechanism can be difficult to
      use, particularly in networks without L3 VPN infrastructure.</t>

      <t>This draft defines a new redirect-to-IP flow-spec action that provides
      a simpler method of policy-based forwarding. The details of the action,
      including the IPv4 or IPv6 target address, are encoded in newly defined
      BGP extended communities.</t>

      <t><xref target="RFC5575">BGP flow-spec</xref> is an extension to BGP
      that allows for the dissemination of traffic flow specification rules.
      This has many possible applications, but the primary one for many network
      operators is the distribution of traffic filtering actions for
      distributed denial of service (DDoS) mitigation.</t>

      <t>Every flow-spec route is a rule, consisting of a matching part encoded
      in the BGP Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) field, and an
      action part encoded in one or more BGP extended communities.  Flow-spec
      defines filter actions such as discard and rate limit. It also defines a
      redirect-to-VRF action for policy-based forwarding. Using the
      redirect-to-VRF action for redirecting traffic towards an alternate
      destination is useful for DDoS mitigation, but it can be complex and
      cumbersome, particularly in networks without L3 VPN infrastructure.</t>

      <t>This draft proposes a new redirect-to-IP flow-spec action that
      provides a simpler method for policy-based forwarding. The details of the
      action, including the IPv4 or IPv6 target address, are encoded in newly
      defined BGP extended communities.</t>

      <name>Redirect-to-IP Extended Communities</name>
      <t>This document defines two new BGP extended communities. The extended
      communities have a type indicating they are transitive and IPv4-
      address-specific or IPv6-address-specific, depending on whether the
      redirection target address is IPv4 or IPv6.</t>

      <t>For the IPv4 address-specific extended community 
      <xref target="RFC4360"/>, the IANA-assigned sub-type value 0x0c indicates
      that the Global Administrator and Local Administrator fields encode a
      flow-spec "redirect-to-IPv4" action. In the encoding of this action, the
      4-octet Global Administrator field encodes the IPv4 address that is the
      redirection target address and the 2-octet local administrator field is
      formatted as shown in Figure 1.</t>

      <t>For the IPv6 address-specific extended community
      <xref target="RFC5701"/>, the IANA-assigned type 0x000c indicates that the
      Global Administrator and Local Administrator fields encode a flow-spec
      "redirect-to-IPv6" action. In this encoding, the 16-octet Global
      Administrator field contains the IPv6 address that is the redirection
      target address and the 2-octet local administrator field is again
      formatted as shown in Figure 1.</t>

      <t>In the local administrator field the least-significant bit is defined
      as the "C" (or copy) bit. When the "C" bit is set the redirection applies
      to copies of the matching packets and not to the original traffic stream.</t>

      <t>All bits other than the "C" bit in the local administrator field MUST
      be set to 0 by the originating BGP speaker and ignored by receiving BGP
      speakers.</t>
      
      <section anchor="validation">
        <name>Validation Procedures</name>
        <t>The validation check described in <xref target="RFC5575"/> and
        revised in <xref target="RFC9117"/> SHOULD be
        applied by default to received flow-spec routes with a "redirect-to-IP"
        extended community, as it is to all types of flow-spec routes. 
        When this check is applied, a flow-spec route with a Destination Prefix
        subcomponent that originated outside the local AS is considered valid
        only if the neighbor AS implied in the AS_PATH attribute is the
        neighbor AS of the unicast IP route that is the best match of the
        destination prefix, and it is also the neighbor AS of all unicast IP
        routes that are longer matches of the destination prefix.</t>

        <!-- XXX JMH - do implementations enforce this restriction on the redirect? -->
        <!-- XXX JMH - the question of origin AS validation is similar to the RPKI one -->
        <t>BGP speakers that support the extended communities defined in this
        draft MUST also, by default, apply additional validation rules when receiving
        a flow-spec with these extended communities.  More specifically, the
        router must consider a "redirect-to-IPv4" or "redirect-to-IPv6"
        extended community to be invalid if the origin AS of the flow-spec
        route does not match the origin AS of the best-match unicast route for
        the "target-address". For example:</t>

        <ul>
          <li> If the flow-spec route has a non-empty AS_PATH indicating origin
          AS = X, and the resolving route of the "target-address" is a BGP route
          with a non-empty AS_PATH indicating origin AS = X, then the extended
          community is considered "valid".</li>
          <li>If the flow-spec route has a null/empty AS_PATH, or an AS_PATH
          with only local confederation elements, and the resolving route of the
          "target-address" is a BGP route with a null/empty AS_PATH or an
          AS_PATH with only local confederation elements then the extended
          community is considered "valid".</li>
          <li>If the flow-spec route has a null/empty AS_PATH, or an AS_PATH
          with only local confederation elements, and the resolving route of the
          "target-address" is a non-BGP route, then the extended community is
          considered "valid".</li>
          <li>If the flow-spec route has a null/empty AS_PATH or an AS_PATH
          with only local confederation elements, and the resolving route of the
          "target-address" is a BGP route that originated outside the local AS
          or confederation, then the extended community is considered
          "invalid".</li>
          <li>If the flow-spec route has a non-empty AS_PATH indicating origin
          AS = X, and the resolving route of the "target-address" is a BGP route
          with a null/empty AS_PATH or an AS_PATH with only local confederation
          elements, or it is a non-BGP route then the extended community is
          considered "invalid".</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- XXX JMH - discarding has the issue that we're setting up trigger
        conditions that may change over the lifetime of the validating routes.
        This is almost certainly wrong. -->
        <t>If any of the above checks determine that a "redirect-to-IP"
        extended community is invalid, the extended community should be
        discarded and not propagated along with the flow-spec route to other
        peers.</t>

        <t>It MUST be possible to disable this additional validation check on a
        per-EBGP session basis.</t>

	<name>Redirecting Matching Flowspec Traffic</name>

	<t>Traffic that is to be redirected/copied for a "redirect-to-IP"
	extended community SHOULD only be redirected if the community type
	matches the traffic type.</t>

	<t>When a BGP speaker receives a flow-spec route with a "redirect-to-IP"
	extended community and this route represents the one and only best path,
	it installs a traffic filtering rule that matches the packets described by
	the NLRI field and redirects them (C=0) or copies them (C=1) towards the
	IPv4 or IPv6 address in the extended community's Global Administrator
	field (the "target address").  The BGP speaker is expected to do a
	longest-prefix-match lookup of the "target address" in the database it
	uses to resolve next-hop addresses and then forward the redirected/copied
	packets based on the resulting route (the "target route"). If the "target
	route" has multiple ECMP next-hops, the redirected/copied packets SHOULD
	be load-shared across these next-hops according to the router's ECMP
	configuration. If the "target route" has one or more tunnel next-hops
	then the appropriate encapsulations SHOULD be added to the
	redirected/copied packets. If the "target address" is invalid or
	unreachable then the extended community SHOULD be ignored.</t>

	<!-- XXX Adam notes the following section isn't supported in Nokia's
	implementation and should be audited vs. actual support across the
	vendors. -->
	<t>If a BGP speaker receives a flow-spec route with multiple
	"redirect-to-IP" extended communities and this route represents the one
	and only best path, it SHOULD load-share the redirected/copied packets
	across all the "target addresses" according to its ECMP configuration. If
	the BGP speaker is not capable of redirecting and copying the same packet
	it SHOULD ignore the extended communities with C=0. If the BGP speaker is
	not capable of redirecting/copying a packet towards multiple "target
	addresses" it SHOULD deterministically select one "target address" and
	ignore the others.</t>

	<!-- XXX Adam notes the following section isn't supported in Nokia's
	implementation and should be audited vs. actual support across the
	vendors. -->
	<t>If a BGP speaker receives multiple flow-spec routes for the same
	flow-spec NLRI and all of them are considered best and usable paths
	according to the BGP speaker's multipath configuration and each one
	carries one or more "redirect-to-IP" extended communities, the BGP speaker
	SHOULD load-share the redirected/copied packets across all the "target
	addresses", with the same fallback rules as discussed in the previous
	paragraph. Note that this situation does not require the BGP speaker to
	have multiple peers; i.e., <xref target="RFC7911">BGP Add-Paths</xref>
	could be used for the flow-spec address family.</t>

	<!-- XXX Adam notes the following section isn't supported in Nokia's
	implementation and should be audited vs. actual support across the
	vendors. -->
	<t>If a BGP speaker receives a flow-spec route with one or more "redirect
	to IP" extended communities and one or more "redirect-to-VRF" extended
	communities, and this route represents the one and only best path, the
	"redirect-to-IP" actions described above should be applied in the context
	of the "target VRF" matching the "redirect-to-VRF" extended community -
	i.e. the "target addresses" should be looked up in the FIB of the "target
	VRF". If there are multiple "redirect-to-VRF" extended communities in the
	route, the "target VRF" SHOULD be the one that matches the
	"redirect-to-VRF" extended community with the highest numerical value. If
	the BGP speaker is not capable of "redirect-to-VRF" followed by 
	"redirect-to-IP" then it SHOULD give preference to performing the
	"redirect-to-VRF" action and doing only longest-prefix-match forwarding
	in the "target VRF".</t>

	<t>If a BGP speaker receives multiple flow-spec routes for the same
	flow-spec NLRI, and all of them are considered best and usable paths
	according to the BGP speaker's multipath configuration, and they carry a
	combination of "redirect-to-IP" and "redirect-to-VRF" extended
	communities, the BGP speaker SHOULD apply the "redirect-to-IP" actions in
	the context of the "target VRF" as described above.  Note that this
	situation does not require the BGP speaker to have multiple peers - i.e.
	<xref target="RFC7911">BGP Add-Paths</xref> could be used for the
	flow-spec address family.</t>

      <name>Security Considerations</name>
      <t>A system that originates a flow-spec route with a "redirect-to-IP"
      extended community can cause many receivers of the flow-spec route to
      send traffic to a single next-hop, overwhelming that next-hop and
      resulting in inadvertent or deliberate denial of service. This is
      particularly a concern when the "redirect-to-IP" extended community is
      allowed to cross AS boundaries. The validation check described in section
      <xref target="validation"/> significantly reduces this risk.</t>
    </section>

    <section>
      <name>IANA Considerations</name>

      <t>IANA has allocated an extended community from the "Transitive
      IPv4-Address-Specific Extended Community Sub-Types" registry.  The
      Sub-Type value is 0x0c.  The Name shall be "Flow-spec Redirect-to-IPv4".
      The Reference shall be this document.</t>

      <t>IANA has allocated an extended community from the "Transitive
      IPv6-Address-Specific Extended Community Types" registry.  The
      Type value is 0x000c.  The Name shall be "Flow-spec Redirect-to-IPv6".
      The Reference shall be this document.</t>

      <t>In a previous draft of this document, IANA had allocated an
      extended community from the "BGP Transitive Extended Community Types"
      registry with Type Value 0x08 for "Flow spec redirect/mirror to IP
      next-hop".  IANA is requested to deprecate this registration.</t>
